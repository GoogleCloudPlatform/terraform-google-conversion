# Supported Resources

If you want to add support for a resource, please [open an enhancement request](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-google-conversion/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=enhancement.md) and consider [contributing code](./contributing/index.md).

The full list of supported resources converting from tfplan to CAI asset can be found in our [GCP Terraform docs](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation/create-cai-constraints#supported_resources).

The only resource supported from converting CAI to tfplan is google_compute_instance.
